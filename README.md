Deploy, build & and install ovirt & vdsm packages on a remote host from src.

### Perquisites
* fabric 
~~~.bash
yum install fabric     # redhat
apt-get install fabric # debian
~~~

* make sure the remote host is reachable by ssh and that it
requires no password using something like ssh-copy-id or kinit.

* sudo is required for various administrative operations
(install & remove rpms, view logs, etc.)
### Usage
Push code[1], build rpms, remove existing rpms and install
vdsm on fe20.example.com and el6.example.com,
run vdsm-tool and attach to log:
~~~.bash
fab -H fe20.example.com,el6.example.com deploy_vdsm
~~~

There is one parameter to all deployment scripts denoting the
repository location:
~~~.bash
fab -H localhost deploy_engine:src=/home/mtayer/ovirt-engine
~~~

Next two are used to install build dependencies on remote.
Currently only fe20 supported.
~~~.bash
fab -H fe20.example.com engine_developers_fe20
fab -H fe20.example.com vdsm_developers_fe20
~~~

### Git post-commit hook

~~~.bash
vim .git/hooks/post-commit
~~~

~~~.bash
OLD=$(pwd)
cd ~/dev/ovirt-fabric 

function finish {
    cd $OLD;  
}
trap finish EXIT

fab -H mtayer-host1.usersys.redhat.com deploy_extension
~~~

~~~.bash
chmod u+x .git/hooks/post-commit
~~~

#### TODO
* work with fab as library and not with a fabfiles. 
* do not delete rpmbuild, instead build to a different location?
* demand force for rpm removal?

[1] code is pushed using git, since vdsm uses git tags for it's
build.
